Chessenger
==========

A jQuery plugin that allows you to create a multiplayer (and single player) chess on your browser.

Currently it's just a chessboard on the browser. I'm still stuck at the client end. You can create a chessboard of your chosen size, side (black or white), and possibly configuration, and voila: here's your chessboard.
